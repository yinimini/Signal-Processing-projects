# Seismic signal processing 

I wanted to know:

1) How do I perform an analysis of the signal in the frequency domain
   
3) What technique(s) do I use to remove noise from the sesmic data

Here are some of the results:

# Signal processing of signal from Frequency Delta Sigma Modulator

I wanted to know: 

1) Does the signal in frequency domain behave like an oversampling converter

2) What the performance parameters of this data converter - SQNR, SINAD and THD

3) Is the signal distorted with the sampling frequency applied to the data converter

4) Can low pass filter and blackman window improve SQNR?

Signal is computed in the frequency domain, SQNR, SINAD and THD are calculated to assess the ADC's performance. 

Low pass filter and blackman window are computed for the attempt to improve SQNR of the output.

Here are some of the results:
